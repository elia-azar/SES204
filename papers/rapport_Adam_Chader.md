## Virtual Communities as communities

Barry Wellman & Milena Gulia (1999) Net Surfers Don't Ride Alone: Virtual Communities as Communities, in Barry Wellman (ed.) Networks in the Global Village, Westview Press: 167-194

Problem : Can people form intimate relationships and communities online ?

Debate pro against :
- pro : Internet create new forms of community
- against : It will destroy community altogether

The Internet can allow for relationships to form regardless of race, gender, or geography. It puts bridges between people were roads couldn't.

But the online communication is different in the sense that it deprives people of the full range of in-person contact. This will lead online people to lose their contact with "real life".

Sociologist have always feared how changes in technology would affect community, but until now, it has never destroyed it. Communities not only consist of neighborhoods and kinship, but also Social Networks of friends, workmates, kins, who are not necessarily close, but can communicate. 
People need to see the Net not as an alternate reality, but as one of the many means of communication available (like post, mail, telephones, etc)

### Are online relationships narrowly specialized or broadly supportive ?
The idealised community can provide its members with a broad range of support.
In reality most communities are somewhat specialized and people have to turn to different ones for different types of support. This goes got Internet communities, which are specialized. Collective online discussions are often topic-oriented (technical, political, ...)
The communities are often specialized, as the Internet is at first a means of getting information, but there exists support groups online, providing mental and physical help.
People not only go online for information, but also for companionship.

### In what ways are the many weak ties on the net useful ?
Net members provide support, information and companionship to people they hardly know offline or who are total strangers.
People are more enclined to help in general when there is nobody else around to help. This explains why peolple online are so eager to help total strangers, beause they are alone. The weak ties, especially proeminent in online relationships, are more apt tha, strong ties to link people with different social characteristivs, and also help maintaining contact with other social circles

### Is there reciprocity online and attachment to virtual communities ?
Reciprocity is a norm of community, what is given ought to be repaid.
The fact that people online are only weak ties does not encourage reciprocity.
However, reciprocity online can be in a different form : people who provide support and information do so as a means of expressing their identity, and increasing their self-esteem, gaining respect, etc.

### Are strong, intimate ties possible online ?
The norm online is weak ties. There exists strong ties online that share similarities to offline ties (encourage frequent and volontary contact, mutual support, reciprocity, ...)Relationship developpement takes longer online than face-to-face. because online communication is usually asynchronous and therefore slower.
On the subject of the longevity of online relationships,  it has been shown that they can be long lasting, but they are more easily disrupted : the messages can easily be misinterpreted, and the asynchronous aspect can hinder reparation of damages.

### How does virtual community affect "real-life" community ?
People think that high involvement in virtual community can move people away from their involvment in real-life communities (cyberaddicts, ...). But this might be a misinterpretation : spending time online does not remove face-to-face, and strong ties are often mainained online and face-to-face. Online communication can also maintain relationships that would otherwise be broken due to distance for example.

### Does the Net increase community diversity ?
The traditional community is seen as a village-like structure composed of socially similar community members tighlty nit together. However, most contemporary western communities re more sparsely knit, and well connectedd to the outside world. Rather than one all encompassing community, individuals are limited members of multiple communities. This results in individuals being exposed to several heterogeneous sources of information and social support. 
The Net encourages this form of community.

Moreover, the lack of social and physical cues online prevents members from knowing if another member has similar social characteristics. This allows relationships to form on the basis of shared interests rather that on the similarity of social status.

### Are virtual communities "real" communities ?
Net maintains strong supportive community ties, and may be increasing the number and diversity of weak ties.
The ties maintained in real life and onlie are very similar : intermittent, specialized and varying in strength.
They differ one the basis of the intimacy : shared interest for online, shared social characteristics offline.
The people who think virtual communities is a danger for community are still based upon their mythological view of community, which does not hold up today

The main difference between irl communities and internet communities is in the amount of weak ties, and the basis of the relationships, which is shared interest, and not social status.
